            VB Common Controls Replacement Project Date Time Picker Control.
                     Public Beta 3 v.0.7.0.7 (VB6 Build) - 18/08/00

This control is a direct replacement for the Date Time Picker Control provided by
MSCOMCT2.OCX. It was created by Jon Evans and Jeremy Adams, members of the VB C
ommon Controls Replacement Project, a group aiming to provide separate ActiveX controls 
to replace and extend the controls found in COMCTL32.OCX and similarly OCXs.

This control also includes new features found in newer versions of COMCTL32.DLL
which is supplied by Microsoft with IE3+. 

This version was compiled with VB6 SP3.

This beta builds on the work done by Jon Evans.

Included Demos:

A demo is included that demonstrates much of the functionality of the control.

Registering the control:

Use RegSvr32 or the Browse button in the Components dialog box within VB
to register the control.
